# artGAN
Keras-based implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, based on code from [Robbie Barrat](https://github.com/robbiebarrat/art-DCGAN), [Soumith Chintala](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch), and [Felix Mohr](https://github.com/FelixMohr/Deep-learning-with-Python/blob/master/DCGAN-MNIST.ipynb). 

## Getting Started

Each python script can be run from the command line. Python 3 is recommended. 

### Dependencies


```
tensorflow
keras
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
```

### Installing

Use install_dependencies.sh to prepare.
